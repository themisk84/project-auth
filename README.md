# Project Auth

In this project Me and Efthymios builded a Backend page and a frontend page that we later connected to each other. We have four endpoints. We used authorization for the accessToken and used the bcrypt.hashSync() to becrypt the password.
You can sign in and upp. when you signing up you have to write a message, that we later display as a secret messae when you are logged in. We allso display error messages for 400, 401, 403 and 11000.
